# ecc_extended_galois_field
A simple python based implementation of the elliptic curve cryptography in the extended Galois field. It also includes implementations for the Diffie-Hellman 
key exchange and DSA with ECC in extended Galois field.The elliptic curve used in this example implementation is in the form y^2+xy = x^3+(g4)*x^2+b where g4 
(g4 = 0011) is an element in the cyclic group for the extended Galois field given by F_(2^4).
